Dirac Build HOW-TO

by Scott Robert Ladd (scott.ladd@coyotyegulch.com)


This document explains the build process for Dirac, based on extracting
the original Dirac source codes from CVS.

Linux
-----
Dirac uses the GNU autotools to generate a configuration script, which
in turn builds system-specific makefiles for generating the Dirac
software.

The reconf script produces the necessary build files from the
configure.ac and Makefile.am sources. The process requires the GNU
utilities aclocal, autoconf, automake, and libtoolize; these tools should
be automatically installed by any Linux distribution, given that most
Linux software requires these utilities.

The Dirac CVS does *not* contain a copy of the configure script, nor
does it contain any of the ancillary files such as ltmain.sh or
aclocal.m4. Use the reconf script to build those files for your
particular development environment:

    # ./reconf
    
The reconf script is designed for Dirac developers as a way of creating
the necessary symbolic links, configuration scripts, and Makefile.ins.

After running reconf (or extracting files from a distribution tarball),
use the standard GNU configuration sequence to generate Makefiles and
build the Dirac programs:

    # ./configure
    # ./make
    # ./make install
    
To create a distribution tarball, use the command:

    # ./make distcheck
    
This will create a Dirac-n.n.n.tar.gz file (where "n.n.n" is the version
number) containing all the files necessary for building Dirac on a
GNU-based system (Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X).

The version number is changed by modifying configure.ac, which also
explains the meaning of the version digits.


Windows
-------
The Dirac distribution includes files for contructing the software using
Microsoft's Developer Studio.NET.
