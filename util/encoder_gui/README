Dirac Encoder GUI application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last revised by Thomas Davies 7 September 2005

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requires Qt 4.0 to be installed. 

In the GUI directory, to build the application type

qmake -project

followed by 

qmake

followed by

make

This will produce an executable with the name of this directory (encoder_gui).

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type 

encoder_gui

at the command line to call up the GUI. The GUI calls the Dirac command-line
tool in the main Dirac package. The encoder parameters are the same as the 
command-line package, which is documented in the main README file in the 
Dirac distribution.

To encode, select the preset that most closely matches the video you're
encoding. This sets sequence and encoding parameters which can then be
overridden. Select input and output video by typing in the location, or 
by using the browse window. You can indicate filenames by specifying the name
with or without extension. For example, specifying

test_in

as the input will set the input video as test_in.yuv, but you can also select

test_in.yuv

WARNING!: at the moment the GUI calls up dirac_encoder only in the current 
directory, i.e. the directory from which the encoder was started up. 

This will change in future.
