dirac-0.4.3
===========
  - Quality metric has changed from PSNR to one based on 4th powers of errors.
    This results in pictures with more stable quality and fewer artefacts.
  - Fixed bug with scaling motion vectors for non 4:4:4 formats.
  - Fixed bug in encoder in downconverting a picture with odd valued dimensions
  - Fixed bug in encoder in handling input with 4:1:1 chroma format.
  - Fixed bug in diagnostics tool in handling input with 4:1:1 chroma format.
  - Updated algorithm documentation

dirac-0.4.2
===========
  - Fixed bugs in writing instrumentation data while encoding which
    caused the diagnostics tool to go into an infinite loop
  - Fixed bug in diagnostic tool when handling reference 2 and only
    one reference frame is available
  - Number of frames in encoded output header is now set correctly to
    the number of frames encoded.
  - Fixed bug with bit-rate being miscalculated when only a section of the 
    sequence is encoded.
  - Fixed bug with setting DC band perceptual weight.

dirac-0.4.1
===========
  - Added support for build under Microsoft Windows using gnu autotools,
    MSYS and no-cost MS VC++ 2003 compiler

  - Fixed bug in building unit tests when older versions of cppunit are 
    installed

  - Fixed bugs in measurement of PSNR and motion estimation process

dirac-0.4.0
===========
  - Added constant quality encoding interface using PSNR
     as the quality measure, and using multi-pass frame
     coding
  - Added Intra-frame insertion and cut detection
  - Added C interface for the decoder application to allow
     interfacing to player software. Refer to the api documentation
     in dirac_parser.h.
  - Implemented unique frame headers to facilitate bit-stream
     parsing
  - Added instrumentation output from encoder and an 
     instrumentation display tool for visualising encoder
     decisions to help with algorithmic development
  - Cleansed and refactored numerous code files to add comments,
     improve readability and modularity
  - Added a unit testing framework based on cppunit for testing
     classes 
  - Fixed bug with vertical block separation always being set
     to 8 pixels
  - Added feature to encode only a section of input video rather
     than the whole sequence
  - Tweaked motion estimation parameters to improve performance,
     mostly for higher-res pictures
  - Included document describing the syntax of Dirac bitstream v0.1
    in the doc directory.
  - Fixed bug 1008694 (Out-of-tree building fails)
  - Fixed header and pkconfig installation
  - Updated algorithm documentation

Dirac-0.3.1
===========
  - Fixed compiling under Windows
  - Video conversion utilites now build under Windows
  - Colour conversion matrix coefficients corrected in conversion utilites

Dirac-0.3.0
===========
  - Added conversion utilities for going to and from RGB and 
     various YUV formats, plus bitmaps
  - Fixed serious artifacts when frame dimensions are not multiples of 32
  - Performance speed up writing output to disk
  - Changed .hdr format from binary to text for cross-platform interoperability
  - Added autotest framework with simple colour-bars test
  - Added format conversion, MPlayer and ImageMagick examples to README
  - Added decoder support for arbitrary temporal prediction structures
  - Added support for I-frame only coding
  - Added support for coding with a single initial I-frame
  - Extended code documentation to all major classes

Dirac-0.2.0
===========
  - Fixed crash when frame dimensions are not multiples of 32
  - Removed dependency on XParam library
  - Removed libtool for faster compiles and ease of debugging
  - Included doxygen documentation of major classes
  - Initial "programmer's guide" documentation - doc/dirac_algor.tex

Dirac-0.1.0
===========
  - Initial Sourceforge release.
