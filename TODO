The list covers both software and algorithmic issues, and is in no particular
order. See also the website at www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/dirac/. If you'd like
to help us fix these, contact us through dirac@rd.bbc.co.uk.

-- [Ongoing]. Documentation for bitstream structure and format.

-- [Ongoing]. Documentation of encoder and decoder algorithms and software.
[The algorithm documentation is now available on www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/dirac/.]

-- Interlace coding tools, for motion estimation and compensation in particular.

-- Support for constant-quality encoding - adaptation of frame Lagrangian
 parameters to hit a quality target. Collation of perceptually-weighted noise.

-- Separable perceptual modelling module, for separate optimisation.

-- Introduce support for encoder-side intra frame insertion/cut detection.

-- Introduce support for frame skipping - bit stream flag + algorithms, decoder
 frame repetition, frame numbers and frame expiry times.
[Flags are now in place, but functionality and encoder-side algorithms need
definition.]

-- Speed-up improvements to motion estimation.

-- Global motion estimation and compensation.

-- Revise WaveletTransform, Subband and SubbandList classes, so that subband
 data is encapsulated by the Subband class rather than packed into a big array
 representing the whole transform. This should be neater but also faster for
 entropy coding since memory access for a particular subband will be more local.

-- Bit-depth refactoring to decouple bit-depths for input pictures, stored
 pictures (including upconverted),motion-compensated residuals and wavelet
 coefficients. Experiment with 8 bits only for stored and input pictures, which
 will speed up motion estimation, motion compensation, wavelet transforms and
 upconversion but may hit compression performance.

-- Further development of wavelet coefficient quantisation tools.

-- Optimise entropy coding context initialisations and resetting for compression
 efficiency

-- DirectShow filter for compressed file format. Require pull pin, buffering and
 multitheading.Integrate with MPlayer also.DirectShow filter for uncompressed
 file format.
[Pending definition of wrapper format and defining of mux/demux classes and functions.]

-- Subclass picture IO classes to support uncompressed video as multiple
 numbered files, supporting common image formats (dpx, tiff etc)
